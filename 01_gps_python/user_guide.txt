## User Guide: Using get_gps_test.py with get_gps.c Library

### Overview
The `get_gps_test.py` script utilizes the `get_gps.c` library, which is a wrapper for the `gpsd` library, to retrieve GPS data from an antenna connected to your device. This program serves as a demonstration of how to use pointers in Python with `ctypes` and pass them to a C library.

### Dependencies
Before using this program, ensure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:
- `gpsd`
- `gpsd-clients`
- `python3`

### Usage
1. Build the `get_gps.c` library by following these steps:
   - Navigate to the root directory of the project.
   - Run the following command to build the `get_gps.c` library:
     ```
     $ make
     ```
   This will compile the `get_gps.c` file into a shared library called `get_gps.so` in the `src` directory.

2. Run the Python script by executing the following command:
    ```
    $ python3 get_gps_test.py
    ```
    This will run the `get_gps_test.py` script, which will call the `get_gps.c` library to retrieve GPS data from the antenna connected to your device
    The script will print the GPS data to the terminal.
